## Project Overview

This project focuses on Brain Tumor Segmentation using deep learning techniques. We are leveraging the BraTS 2017 dataset, which contains a variety of MRI scans of brain tumor patients. The primary goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately segment different tumor regions in brain MRI images, helping in the diagnosis and treatment planning for patients.

Our project aims to preprocess this data, train a segmentation model, and evaluate its performance.
